# conr: Helping with Health Economics

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

conr is a package to provide templates and convenience functions for work in 
health economics.
It is my first package and will be bug-ridden.

## Templates

To this point, there is an Rmarkdown template to produce an html document, 
example below.

## Functions

Random bits of code that may be useful. 

All functions (see their code in R/):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
list.files("./R/")
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of conr from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("connor-ballinger/conr")
```

## Ideas to Add

-   Functions to fix/improve:

    -   print_regn


-   New functions:

    -   functions for decision modelling
    -   create labels and data dictionary
    -   2SB with shrinkage correction (NG 2013)
    -   mean & quantiles (for bootstrap output, multiple variables)
    -   wrappers to simplify use of gtsummary
    -   style all sorts of tables
    -   source files up to a specific number (e.g. "05_")

-   Another template - word or pdf or shiny or a multi-page html.

## Package Overview

```{r}
fs::dir_tree()
```
